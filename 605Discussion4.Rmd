##T10 Exercise MM.T35 asked you to show that ${ AA }^{ \ast  }$ is Hermitian. Prove directly that ${ AA }^{ \ast  }$ is a normal matrix.

We have the condition for a matrix to be Hermitian.:

$${ A=A }^{ \ast  }$$
When a matrix is equal to its adjoint.

and the condition for a matrix to be normal:

$${ A }^{ \ast  }A={ AA }^{ \ast  }$$

If a matrix commutes with its adjoint. Given these two conditions we can show that every Hermitian matrix is also a Normal matrix:

If this is true:

$$1.\qquad { A=A }^{ \ast  }$$

then it follows that:

$$2.\qquad AA={ A }^{ \ast  }A$$
is also true.

Then substituting 1 into 2:

$$3.\qquad A{ A }^{ * }={ A }^{ \ast  }A$$
This shows that every Hermitian matrix is also a Normal matrix.
